# BakingApp

A baking recipe application that receives incomplete JSON data from an API and displays recipe information including videos for each step. Recipes are saved using the Room Database and Android Architecture Components(Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle). Recipes are from Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam. BakingApp features tablet screen detection and compatibility and a home screen widget.
